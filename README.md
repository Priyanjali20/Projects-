Project 1 : Smart Wheelchair with fall detection and alerts 
The "Smart Wheelchair with Fall Detection and Alerts" project is designed to enhance the safety and mobility of individuals with physical disabilities. 
Using an ESP32 microcontroller, an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor, the system detects falls based on sudden changes in motion and orientation. 
When a fall is detected, it sends alerts to caregivers via Telegram for real-time notifications.
